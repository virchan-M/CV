  <p><strong>Wear Prediction of Brake Pads by Force Analysis and Machine Learning techniques :</strong> Python, CAD,
    ANSYS, Machine Learning
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Employ Machine Learning to predict the brake parameters such as Wear, Maximum Stress, Equivalent
      Elastic Strain of two designs of brake systems. The regression model was built on data points collected
